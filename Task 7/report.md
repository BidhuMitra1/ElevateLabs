### Report on Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

#### Objective
The task aimed to learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions using any web browser (Chrome, Firefox) and to document the process, including a list of suspicious extensions found and removed (if any).

#### Steps Taken (Following Hints/Mini Guide)
1. **Opened Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Manager**  
   - In Chrome: Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` via the address bar.  
   - In Firefox: Went to `about:addons` or accessed through the menu (Menu > Add-ons and Themes).  

2. **Reviewed All Installed Extensions**  
   - Checked the list of extensions for any unfamiliar or unnecessary ones.  

3. **Checked Permissions and Reviews**  
   - Examined permissions requested by each extension (e.g., access to all website data, browsing history).  
   - Looked up reviews on the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site for any red flags like poor ratings or user complaints about privacy issues.  

4. **Identified Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions**  
   - Noted extensions with excessive permissions (e.g., access to all data on all websites without a clear purpose).  
   - Flagged extensions with no clear functionality or those not actively used.  

5. **Removed Suspicious Extensions**  
   - In Chrome: Clicked "Remove" on the extension card.  
   - In Firefox: Selected "Remove" next to the extension in the Add-ons Manager.  

6. **Restarted Browser and Checked Performance**  
   - Restarted the browser to ensure no lingering effects.  
   - Noted any improvements in speed or functionality post-removal.  

7. **Researched Malicious Extensions’ Impact**  
   - Investigated how malicious extensions can harm users (e.g., data theft, injecting ads, redirecting searches).  

8. **Documented Steps and Extensions Removed**  
   - Recorded the process and findings (see Deliverable below).  

#### Deliverable: List of Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed
- **No suspicious extensions were identified during this process.**  
   - All installed extensions (e.g., Grammarly, AdBlock, LastPass) were recognized, actively used, and had reasonable permissions with positive reviews.  
   - No removals were necessary.  

#### Outcome
Achieved awareness of browser security risks and learned how to manage extensions effectively.

#### Conclusion
No suspicious extensions were found, but the process highlighted the importance of regularly auditing browser extensions, understanding their permissions, and maintaining browser security to mitigate risks.
