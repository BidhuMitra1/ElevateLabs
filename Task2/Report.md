Phishing Email Analysis Report

Email Details:
Subject: Microsoft account password change
Claimed Sender: Microsoft Support
Actual Sender Address: support@msupdate.net

Phishing Indicators Identified
1. Spoofed Sender Address:
The email claims to be from Microsoft, but the sender address is support@msupdate.net, which is not an official Microsoft domain.
Legitimate Microsoft emails typically originate from @microsoft.com or @accountprotection.microsoft.com.

2. Impersonation of a Trusted Brand:
The email uses Microsoft branding and formatting to create a false sense of legitimacy. However, attackers often mimic corporate style to deceive recipients.

3. Generic Greeting and Lack of Personalization:
The email does not address the user by name, which is a common trait of phishing emails. Legitimate services usually personalize such alerts.

4. Suspicious IP Address and Location Info:
The IP address 77.196.86.10 and country (United States) are included possibly to lend authenticity, but may be fabricated or spoofed.

5. Unfamiliar Domain in Links (Potentially Malicious):
Although not visible in the screenshot, phishing emails often contain malicious links masked under legitimate-looking anchor text like "Reset your password" or "Learn how to make your account more secure."
Hovering over links before clicking is critical to reveal suspicious redirections.

6. Urgency and Security Trigger:
The email includes a common tactic: a security warning that attempts to alarm the user with the message “Your account has been compromised,” urging immediate action.

7. Lack of Microsoft-Specific Authentication or Footer:
Authentic Microsoft emails usually include copyright details, legal links (Privacy, Terms), and security tips at the bottom, which are absent here.

Conclusion"

A spoofed sender address,
Brand impersonation,
Absence of personalization,
Potentially malicious links, and
The use of urgent language to induce panic.

These elements strongly indicate that the email is a phishing attempt designed to deceive the recipient and potentially steal account credentials or personal data.
